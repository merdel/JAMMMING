# JAMMMING
This is a practice project I'm working on along with Codecademy.
Jammming is a React web application that allows users to search the Spotify library, create custom playlists, and save them to their Spotify account. This project leverages React components, state management, and requests with the Spotify API to provide a seamless music discovery and playlist creation experience.

## Purpose

The purpose of Jammming is to provide users with a platform to discover music from the Spotify library, create personalized playlists, and seamlessly export them to their Spotify account for listening on the go.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Spotify API
- Git (for version control)
- GitHub (for hosting the repository)
- Deployment platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

## Features

- **Search for Songs**: Users can search for songs by title, artist, or album.
- **Song Information**: Users can view details about each song, including title, artist, and album.
- **Custom Playlist**: Users can create custom playlists by adding songs from search results.
- **Export to Spotify**: Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account.

## Future Work

- Implement additional search filters, such as genre or release date.
- Improve user interface and design for better usability.
- Add authentication for users to access their Spotify account directly within the app.
- Enhance playlist management features, such as editing or deleting playlists.
